{"name":"ThumbFish","tagline":"A simple utility for Chemists that integrates with Windows and provides molecule Thumbnail, Preview, Search and other useful features.","body":"# About ThumbFish\r\nThumbFish is a set of Windows Shell Extension handlers developed to help people working with the following chemical structure files:\r\n* [MOL (MDL Molfile Format - V2000 and V3000)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file#Molfile)\r\n* RXN (Reaction file - V2000 and V3000)\r\n[SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_file_format#SMILES)\r\n* [SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiles_arbitrary_target_specification)\r\n* [SDF (Structure Data File - V2000 and V3000)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file#SDF)\r\n* RDF (Reaction Data File - V2000 and V3000)\r\n* [CML (Chemical Markup Language)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Markup_Language)\r\n\r\nThe handlers makes it easy to identify and search these chemical files without opening the associated application. These handlers are NOT dependent on any specific commercial Chemistry application. It uses the open source chemistry organic toolkit named [Indigo by GGA Software](http://www.ggasoftware.com/opensource/indigo). ThumbFish contains the following Shell Extension Handlers for Windows OS:\r\n* Thumbnail Handler\r\n* Preview Handler\r\n* IFilter Search Handler\r\n* Shell Context-Menu Handler\r\n\r\nFor Bugs, suggestions or feedback, please email abhimanyusirohi@gmail.com\r\n\r\n# Known Limitations\r\n1. Copying structure as Enhanced Metafile (EMF) Picture does not display atom labels.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
